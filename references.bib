abstract = {Power grid is a major part of modern Critical Infrastructure (CIN). The rapid evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enables traditional power grids to encompass advanced technologies that allow them to monitor their state, increase their reliability, save costs and provide ICT services to end customers, thus converting them into smart grids. However, smart grid is exposed to several security threats, as hackers might try to exploit vulnerabilities of the industrial infrastructure and cause disruption to national electricity system with severe consequences to citizens and commerce. This paper investigates and compares honey-x technologies that could be applied to smart grid in order to distract intruders, obtain attack strategies, protect the real infrastructure and form forensic evidence to be used in court. © 2019 IEEE.},

ABSTRACT = {The smart grid provides advanced functionalities, including real-time monitoring, dynamic energy management, advanced pricing mechanisms, and self-healing, by enabling the two-way flow of power and data, as well as the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and devices. However, converting the traditional power grids to smart grids poses severe security challenges and makes their components and services prone to cyber attacks. To this end, advanced techniques are required to mitigate the impact of the potential attacks. In this paper, we investigate the use of honeypots, which are considered to mimic the common services of the smart grid and are able to detect unauthorized accesses, collect evidence, and help hide the real devices. More specifically, the interaction of an attacker and a defender is considered, who both optimize the number of attacks and the defending system configuration, i.e., the number of real devices and honeypots, respectively, with the aim to maximize their individual payoffs. To solve this problem, game theoretic tools are used, considering an one-shot game and a repeated game with uncertainty about the payoff of the attacker, where the Nash Equilibrium (NE) and the Bayesian NE are derived, respectively. Finally, simulation results are provided, which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

ABSTRACT = {The technological leap of smart technologies and the Internet of Things has advanced the conventional model of the electrical power and energy systems into a new digital era, widely known as the Smart Grid. The advent of Smart Grids provides multiple benefits, such as self-monitoring, self-healing and pervasive control. However, it also raises crucial cybersecurity and privacy concerns that can lead to devastating consequences, including cascading effects with other critical infrastructures or even fatal accidents. This paper introduces a novel architecture, which will increase the Smart Grid resiliency, taking full advantage of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology. The proposed architecture called SDN-microSENSE architecture consists of three main tiers: (a) Risk assessment, (b) intrusion detection and correlation and (c) self-healing. The first tier is responsible for evaluating dynamically the risk level of each Smart Grid asset. The second tier undertakes to detect and correlate security events and, finally, the last tier mitigates the potential threats, ensuring in parallel the normal operation of the Smart Grid. It is noteworthy that all tiers of the SDN-microSENSE architecture interact with the SDN controller either for detecting or mitigating intrusions.},

abstract = {New generation passive optical networks (NG-PONs) are emerged as promising technologies for delivering bandwidth-demanding services in modern access networks. The 10-gigabit-capable passive optical network (XG-PON) standard has been proposed as a high-throughput architecture that realizes the Fiber-To-The-x (FTTx) paradigm, where x stands for curb (FTTC), building (FTTB) or home (FTTH). XG-PON is a powerful technology, capable of supporting 10 Gbit/s in the downstream and 2.5 Gbit/s in the upstream direction. However, in order to fully utilize the huge bandwidth in such technology, an efficient and fair bandwidth allocation scheme is required for adequately coordinating the transmission opportunities of the involved network entities based on their real bandwidth demands. A multitude of techniques and schemes have been presented over the last few years aiming at providing dynamic bandwidth distribution in PONs and NG-PONs systems. However, the vast majority of those techniques are based on heuristics. This paper develops a novel bandwidth distribution algorithm which is based on the tragedy of the commons theory, aiming at ensuring a fair bandwidth distribution among the Optical Network Units (ONUs) in a deployed XG-PON system. The algorithm is able to apply a balanced bandwidth distribution schedule amongst the connected ONUs, formed as players, aiming at ensuring a fair transmission opportunity arrangement in the upstream direction. © 2018 IEEE.},

ABSTRACT = {The scheduled maintenance of industrial equipment is usually performed with a low frequency, as it usually leads to unpredicted downtime in business operations. Nevertheless, this confers a risk of failure in individual modules of the equipment, which may diminish its performance or even lead to its breakdown, rendering it non-operational. Lately, predictive maintenance methods have been considered for industrial systems, such as power generation stations, as a proactive measure for preventing failures. Such methods use data gathered from industrial equipment and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify data patterns that indicate anomalies and may lead to potential failures. However, industrial equipment exhibits specific behavior and interactions that originate from its configuration from the manufacturer and the system that is installed, which constitutes a great challenge for the effectiveness of ML model maintenance and failure predictions. In this article, we propose a novel method for tackling this challenge based on the development of a digital twin for industrial equipment known as a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU). RTUs are used in electrical systems to provide the remote monitoring and control of critical equipment, such as power generators. The method is applied in an RTU that is connected to a real power generator within a Public Power Corporation (PPC) facility, where operational anomalies are forecasted based on measurements of its processing power, operating temperature, voltage, and storage memory.},
